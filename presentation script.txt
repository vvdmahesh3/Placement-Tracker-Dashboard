1. Introduction (1 minute)
"Hi everyone, we’re Team [Your Team Name], and we’re excited to present our project, Placement Tracker Web. Our goal is to help students and administrators track placement-related activities, such as job applications, interviews, and offers. Let me introduce our team:

V V D Mahesh Peruri: Frontend and Backend Developer
Kadali Venu: Frontend Developer
Tirumareddi Durga Prasad: Backend Developer
Muralasetti Naga Chakra Satya Sai: Data Collector
Velanati Veera Venkata Sai: Document Creator
Together, we’ve built a solution to simplify the placement process for students and administrators."

2. Problem and Solution (1.5 minutes)
"The problem we’re addressing is the lack of a centralized platform for students to track their placement activities. Many students struggle to keep track of job applications, interview schedules, and placement statuses. This leads to missed opportunities and inefficiencies.
Our solution, Placement Tracker Web, is a web application that allows students to:
Track job applications: Add, update, and delete placement records.
Manage interviews: Schedule and track interview details.
View progress: Get real-time updates on their placement status.
What makes our solution unique is its real-time database powered by Firebase, which ensures data is always up-to-date and accessible from any device."

3. Demo (2 minutes)
"Now, let me walk you through our project.
Landing Page: Here, users can learn about the platform and sign up or log in.
Dashboard: After logging in, users see a summary of their placement activities, including total applications, interviews cleared, and offers received.
Application Tracker: Users can add new job applications, update their status, and delete entries.
Interview Schedule: Users can add interview details, such as company name, job role, and interview date.
Profile Page: Users can view and edit their personal information.
We built this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Firebase for the backend, including Firestore for real-time data storage and Authentication for secure user login."

4. Impact and Future Plans (1.5 minutes)
"Our project has the potential to make a significant impact by helping students stay organized and focused during the placement process. It also provides administrators with tools to manage placement activities more efficiently.
In the future, we plan to:
Add AI-powered resume feedback to help students improve their resumes.
Integrate a job recommendation system to suggest relevant job openings.
Implement a notification system to remind users of upcoming interviews and deadlines.
Expand the platform to include multi-language support and offline mode.
We believe this will make the placement process smoother and more accessible for everyone. Thank you for listening, and we’d love to hear your feedback!"
